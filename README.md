# RippleChat
RippleChat is a meant to be a TinySSB compatible chat client. It is started as a university project as a proof of concept for p2p messaging in a Secure Scuttlebut fashion on iOS.
At this stage it communicates via BLE.
It is not currently compatible with TinySSB conforming apps like (Tremola)[https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/tremola].
Future work inlcudes switching to the tinySSB protocol and heavily beautifying th UI.
